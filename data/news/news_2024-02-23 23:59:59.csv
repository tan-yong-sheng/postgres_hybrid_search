The rising energy demand which leads to environmental and economic implications has heightened the urgency of addressing how energy sources are harnessed and managed for clean transition that represent best practices across businesses. Arguably, energy sources used by the renewable energy industry may not be all green. For instance, power generation by burning organic material from sustainable forests may be considered renewable. However, since it generates CO2, it may not necessarily be classified as green energy. This perspective underlines a necessity for businesses to explore strategies aimed at managing or, at least mitigating, the impact of different energy sources on their carbon footprint generation. Two key mechanisms, widely discussed in ESG spheres, emerge as instrumental in shaping a lower-carbon future with their sustainable principles and frameworks: RECs1 and CC2.","<div class=newsTextDataWrapInner><p>KAB's Perspective on the Decarbonisation Dynamics: Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Carbon Credits (CC)</p></div><div class=""ceonothumb pb-5 imgw-800 mx-auto d-block""><a class=""mobx embedimg-icon"" data-rel=""ceolightbox"" href=""//myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2024/Kinergy-Advancement_BC23022024_img1_tem.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""//myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2024/Kinergy-Advancement_BC23022024_img1_tem.jpg"" /></a></div><div class=newsTextDataWrapInner><p>Energy sources are inherently vital as we live in a modern world with the rapidly evolving as",,,https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Kinergy-Advancement_BC23022024_thumbnail_tem.jpg,https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/Kinergy-Advancement_BC23022024_thumbnail_tem.jpg,52,TheEdge,http://www.theedgemarkets.com/categories/malaysia
