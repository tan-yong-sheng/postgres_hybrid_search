Last year, 13% of the world’s young labour force – that is, individuals aged 15 to 24 – were unemployed, according to data from the International Labour Organization (ILO). It was the lowest rate in 15 years and a decrease from pre-pandemic times in all but three subregions. In those three subregions – the Arab states, East Asia and Southeast Asia and the Pacific – the youth unemployment rate in 2023 was higher than in 2019. In Southeast Asia and the Pacific (under which Malaysia falls), the unemployment rate grew to 9.9%, from 8.9% in 2019.","<div class=newsTextDataWrapInner><p><span style=""font-style: italics;"">This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly on August 26, 2024 - September 1, 2024</span></p></div><div><img alt="""" class=""gallery-items"" data-high-res-src=""//myassets.theedgemalaysia.com/pics/2024/TEM1538-infographic_theedgemalaysia.jpg"" src="""" /></div>
